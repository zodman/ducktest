## Approach

The problem what I understand its creation a system when everyone can register a
record of the feeding of ducks.

    * Record date
    * Duck type of feeding
    * Kind of the food
    * Location of the record
    * Quantify of ducks
    * Quantify of food

Then I write the CRUD of the application and introduce a small dashboard.

## Technology


I used Django with a lot of djangopackages:

check requirements.in file

Why ?
Well, I'm python developer. And I consider python ninja!
